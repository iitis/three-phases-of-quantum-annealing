# Three phases of quantum annealing: Fast, slow, and very slow
Artur Soriani, Pierre Nazé, Marcus V. S. Bonança, Bartłomiej Gardas, and Sebastian Deffner

## Description
This is the code required to reproduce all results presented in the paper [Three phases of quantum annealing: Fast, slow, and very slow](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.105.042423) published in journal Physical Review A.
The code is written by Artur Soriani.

## How to run
1. To compile this code, use `g++ -std=c++14 TI_comented.cpp -o TI.x`
2. When compiled, type `./TI.x 100 log -2 2` to run the program.
